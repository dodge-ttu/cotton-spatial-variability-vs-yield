# Cotton Spatial Variability vs Yield
An analysis of the interaction between spatial variability and yield outcomes in cotton. This is an ongoing analysis relating to rain-fed cotton spatial distribution and yield outcomes. The objective is to obtain a better understanding of the extent to which cotton compensation can overcome poor stand quality in a rain-fed envrionment.
